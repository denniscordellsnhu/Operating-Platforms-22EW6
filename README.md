Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based gamebe called “Draw It or Lose It" that can run on multiple platforms. the game needs one or more teams involved	Each team must have multiple people and the Game and Team names must be unique to allow users to check whether the name is in use or free and	Only one instance of the game can exist at any time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? I kept the document clear, concise, and to the point.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? It aids in keeping your focus on the task on hand and to decide on what tasks are important and which ones don't need time and focus on.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? the Evaluation could be made more clear and simplified.The evaluation section comparing and contrasting popular OSs (i.e. Mac, Windows, Linux) and mobile platforms could be improved with a deeper dive into the nuances between the platforms on the client side. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? The Key-needs to consider for the user when developing web based apps are speed and intuitiveness (i.e. usability). it is extremely important that the user can easily understand the interface of the game otherwise no matter how good the game is they will not enjoy it.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
To design software, start vague and work toward preciseness. Take high level objectives and work them through varying iterations to turn them into the final solution while focusing on make sure to have clear documentation to allow easier updates and maintenence.
